With iOS 12 or later, Siri Shortcuts let you quickly do everyday tasks, and with the apps you use the most â€” all with just a tap or by asking Siri. SP Siri Shortcuts are simple and easy to use and require little to no set up to get started. You can run any Shortcut by asking Siri; invoking the Shortcut with a customizable, simple phrase that you'll remember.

## Caveats

A very critical shortcoming of these Shortcuts is the fact that it relies on a reverse engineered API, which may be subject to change at any time. Please open an issue with the Issues tab if you find any of the features not behaving normally.
